/*
Dog has three constructors, and the make() methods inside the functional interfaces
reflect the constructor argument lists (the make() methods can have different
names).

Notice how we use Dog::new for each of [1], [2], and [3]. Thereâ€™s only one name for
all three constructors: ::new. But the constructor reference is assigned to a different
interface in each case, and the compiler can detect from that which constructor
reference to use.

The compiler can see that calling your functional method (make(), in this example)
means to call the constructor.
