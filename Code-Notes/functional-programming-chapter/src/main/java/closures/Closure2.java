What if i is local to makeFun()? Under normal circumstances, i is gone when

    The IntSupplier returned by makeFun() closes over i and x, thus both are still
    valid when you invoke the returned function. Notice, however, I didnâ€™t increment i
    as in Closure1.java. Trying to increment it produces a compile-time error:

    "local variables referenced from a lambda expression must be final or effectively final"
    But if we make the i or x final, we can't increment it anyway.
