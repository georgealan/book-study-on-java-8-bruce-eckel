    /*
    Strategy provides the interface that carries functionality in its single approach() method. By creating different
    Strategy objects you create different behavior. Traditionally we implement this behavior by making a class that
    implements the Strategy interface, as in Soft.

    • [1] In Strategize, you can see that Soft is the default strategy, as it is assigned in the constructor.

    • [2] A slightly less verbose and more spontaneous approach is to create an anonymous inner class.
    There’s still a fair amount of repetitious code, and you always have to look at it until you say
    oh, I see, they’re using an anonymous inner class.

    • [3] This is the Java 8 lambda expression, distinguished by the arrow -> separating the argument and function body.
    To the right of the arrow is the expression that is returned from the lambda. This achieves the same effect as
    the class definition and anonymous inner class, but with a lot less code.

    • [4] This is the Java 8 method reference, distinguished by the ::. To the left of the :: is the name of a class
    or object, and to the right of the :: is the name of a method, but without an argument list.

    • [5] After using the default Soft strategy, we step through all the strategies in the array and place each
    one into s using changeStrategy().

    • [6] Now, each call to communicate() produces different behavior, depending on the strategy code object that’s
    being used at the moment. We pass behavior, rather than only passing data.

    Prior to Java 8, we have been able to pass functionality via [1] and [2] However, the
    syntax has been so awkward to write and read that we’ve only done it when forced.
    Method references and lambda expressions make it possible to pass functionality
    when you want to, instead of only when you must.
