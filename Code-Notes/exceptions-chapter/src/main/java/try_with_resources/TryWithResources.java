/*
Before Java 7, a try was always followed by a {, but now it can be followed
by a parenthesized definitionâ€”here our creation of the FileInputStream object.
The part within parentheses is called the resource specification header. Now in is
available throughout the rest of the try block. More importantly, no matter how
you exit the try block (normally or via exception), the equivalent of the previous
finally clause is executed, but without writing that messy and tricky code. This is
an important improvement.
