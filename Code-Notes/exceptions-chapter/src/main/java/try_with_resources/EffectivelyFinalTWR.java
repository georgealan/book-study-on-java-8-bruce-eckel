/*
jdk9() passes exceptions out by specifying throws IOException. This is because
the definitions of r1 and r2 are no longer inside a try, as they are in old(). The
inability to catch exceptions is one reason this new feature seems questionable.

Itâ€™s also possible to reference variables after they have been released by the try-withresources,
as you can see at the end of jdk9(). The compiler allows this, but you get
an exception when you access r1 or r2 outside the try block.

It is not clear that the benefit of this new feature is worth the cost of moving this
check from compile-time to runtime, and also losing the catch clause. It might be a
good idea to avoid this feature altogether.
