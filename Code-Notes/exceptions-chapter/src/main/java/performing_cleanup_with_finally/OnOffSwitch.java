/*
The goal here is to make sure the switch is off when main() completes, so sw.off()
is placed at the end of the try block and at the end of each exception handler. But
an exception might be thrown that isnâ€™t caught here, so sw.off() would be missed.
However, with finally you can place the cleanup code from a try block in just one
place:
 */
        // WITH FINALLY
        System.out.println("block try with finally");
        try {
            sw2.on();
            // Code that can throw exceptions
            OnOffSwitch.f();
        } catch (OnOffException1 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException1");
        } catch (OnOffException2 e) {
            System.out.println("OnOffException2");
        } finally {
            sw2.off(); // Here sw.off() is guaranteed to run no matter what happens.
        }


    }
