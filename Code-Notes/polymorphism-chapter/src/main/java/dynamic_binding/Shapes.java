/**
 * Now you know you have Shapes, but you donâ€™t know anything more specific

 * for each one, the correct type-specific behavior magically occurs,
 * as you see from the output when you run the program.
 *
 * The point of creating the shapes randomly is to drive home the understanding that
 * the compiler can have no special knowledge that allows it to make the correct calls
 * at compile time. All the calls to draw() must be made through dynamic binding.
