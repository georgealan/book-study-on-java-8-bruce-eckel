/*
    This class initializes the system and adds all the appropriate events. The Restart
    event is repeatedly run, and it loads the eventList into the GreenhouseControls
    object each time.

    Itâ€™s more flexible to read the events from a file instead of hard-coding them.
    This example moves you toward an appreciation of the value of inner classes,
    especially when used within a control framework.
